The Nile River Basin which covers 1/10 of the continent contributed to the rise of Ancient Egypt. Every year around July, the Nile floods the land as a result of melting ice in the mountains, leaving behind a rich deposit called silt. This helps farmers grow crops better and therefore support families. The river also provided easy transportation and communication between villages, therefore helping build one of the largest civilizations.",

Along with the Yangtze River, it creates the only suitable farmland in China, the North China plain. Yellow River deposits large amounts of brown and sand-like fertile soil called Loess, which is carried from the deserts. However, the Yellow River also had devastating floods that could single-handedly wipe out villages. According to the legend, the first dynasty, the Xia dynasty, emerged around this time. Its leader, a mathematician and engineer called Yu, constructed irrigation systems that controlled the Yellow River and its tributaries that helped settlements grow. The legend of Yu reflects the level of technology of a society making the transition to civilization.",

The civilization of Sumer was the first to emerge. They were one of the first to develop a writing system, primarily thanks to cuneiform, a wedge-shaped script where words were carved onto. It was made of reed and clay, both of which were available because of the rivers. Their location also contributed to the diversity of cultures. Since they were located in between the Indus Valley civilization and Egyptian civilization, people often met in Mesopotamia and therefore helped spread their culture and achieve cultural diffusion.",

In the North, the storm gods were highly looked upon because the area was characterized by agriculture reliant on rainfall and dry farming, and they controlled the amount of rain. The storm god was less important in the South, where farmers relied on irrigation, something the storm god couldn’t control.",
